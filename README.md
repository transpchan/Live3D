### Project history

<i>2021/09</i> The Live3D [beta is online](https://twitter.com/transpchan/status/1437971798600175622).

<i>2021/11</i> The Live3D beta is offline, due to the new [CVPR](https://github.com/transpchan/Live3D/blob/main/cvpr_20211117.pdf) policy. Live3D v1 is renamed to CoNR.

<i>2022/02</i> CoNR is [rejected by CVPR](https://github.com/transpchan/Live3D/blob/main/cvpr.pdf).

<i>2022/07</i> CoNR is [rejected by ECCV](https://github.com/transpchan/Live3D/blob/main/eccv.pdf). Code is released. 

<i>2022/08</i> Stay tuned for [Live3D v2](https://github.com/transpchan/Live3D-v2).

<i>2022/08</i> @transpchan was kicked out from the authors of  [Live3Dv1](https://github.com/transpchan/Live3D) as I refused to continue submittion after seeing the [heart-breaking reviews](https://github.com/transpchan/Live3D) from ECCV22. 

Further submission of Live3Dv1 will be done by former coauthors alone. Although our collaboration is broken, I still wish them good luck.

<i>2022/10</i> Check out [Live3D v2](https://github.com/transpchan/Live3D-v2), CoNR with Attention: An Incremental Improvement for Anime Character Animation.
